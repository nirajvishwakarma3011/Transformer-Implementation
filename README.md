# Transformer Implementation ðŸš€

This repository contains an **implementation of a Transformer model** from scratch using **PyTorch**. The project explores the architecture, key components, and training process of transformers, focusing on natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
- Implemented a **Transformer model** from scratch using **PyTorch**.
- Incorporated key components such as:
  - **Multi-head attention**
  - **Positional encoding**
  - **Feedforward neural networks**
  - **Layer normalization**
- Trained the model on the **Opus Books dataset** for translation tasks.
- Visualized **attention weights** to interpret how the model focuses on different input sequences during translation.


## ðŸ”¥ Implementation Details
### âœ… **1. Transformer Model**
- Inspired by the **Attention Is All You Need** paper.
- Implements **encoder-decoder architecture** with:
  - Self-attention and cross-attention layers.
  - Positional encodings for handling word order.
  - Layer normalization and residual connections.

### âœ… **2. Training Process**
- **Dataset:** Opus Books dataset for translation tasks.
- **Optimizer:** Adam with learning rate scheduling.
- **Loss Function:** Cross-entropy loss.


### ðŸ“Š Results & Observations
- Successfully trained a Transformer model for translation.
- Attention visualization shows how the model aligns words during translation.
- Demonstrated the impact of multi-head attention and positional encoding.
  
### ðŸ“Œ Future Enhancements
- âœ… Implement Transformer XL for handling longer sequences.
- âœ… Experiment with pre-trained models like BERT or GPT for comparison.
- âœ… Optimize training with mixed-precision and distributed computing.
